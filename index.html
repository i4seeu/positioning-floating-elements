				<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
				<br>
				<p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
				<p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>

             <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
               reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang,
               and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation,
               looked right.

               Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
               cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
               led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
               detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational
               waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when
               it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
               They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
               and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
